This project modeled distribution of Northern Goshawk in Oregon based on citizen data. I applied DBSCAN clustering to identify spatial patterns in presence data, I then trained a Random Forest and XGBoost models using variables significant variables like elevation, land cover, and temperature. Random Forest had an accuracy of 84.9% and AUC of 92.1%. A major challenge in this project was processing large raster datasets through a laptop- it required high memory and computation time. Future improvements include addressing variable collinearity, refining spatial extent, and implementing more complex bias mitigation to enhance prediction accuracy.
