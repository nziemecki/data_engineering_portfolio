# Project Overview: Database Design for Mortality ETL Pipeline

This project processes raw mortality into optimized, query-ready tables. It creates normalized reference tables for mortality metrics and codes, transforms spatial data with coordinate system conversions, and builds a final mortality metrics table aggregated by year and geographic district. Indexes on key columns and spatial indices improve query performance. The pipeline demonstrates skills in SQL transformations, spatial data handling with PostGIS, and database optimization.
